# Changelog

## 2026.4.12

### New Features
- **QClaw compatibility**: Auto-detects state directory (`~/.qclaw/` or `~/.openclaw/`), works seamlessly on both OpenClaw CLI and QClaw desktop
- **Bilingual UI**: Full Chinese and English interface with auto-detection and manual language switch via Settings panel
- **Topic discussions**: Start multi-citizen group discussions with structured turn-taking and AI-moderated dialogue
- **Dynamic model display**: Shows actual model name from runtime config instead of hardcoded value

### Bug Fixes
- **Agent routing**: Messages now correctly route to `town-steward` via explicit SessionKey format, regardless of `agents.list` order
- **Session history**: Fixed variable shadowing that silently broke chat history loading
- **Hardcoded paths**: All `~/.openclaw/` references replaced with centralized `stateDir()` resolution
- **Archived sessions**: Fixed path construction in `listArchivedSessions` that referenced a function instead of a string

### Documentation
- Updated README (EN + CN) with QClaw install guide, compatibility table, and new features
- Updated ROADMAP with QClaw compatibility milestones
- Added GitHub issue/PR templates
